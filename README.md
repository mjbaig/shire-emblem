# Shire Emblem: Engage

## Project Structure
The parent directory contains `shire-emblem-main`, which is the godot engine directory and `shire-emblem-lib` which is the library directory.

The godot project is written in C# and the library is written in rust. I did this because I can and not because I should have. 

This is the library I used to get the FFI for rust working with godot: git@github.com:godot-rust/gdext.git
